 in addition to having the logos be the same size, 
 i also want to change the header color theme on each site,


  `````and then have little details changed such as at the bottom of every page it says "Copyright Sonoma Racquets 2019" but that wording will need to change for each site.

 the little "SR" icon next to each site name in the web search bar will need to be removed or changed.
